        <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Complete a Medical certificate of cause of death (MCCD)</h1>

        <p class="govuk-body">Use this digital MCCD to create or complete a Medical certificate of cause of death (MCCD). It is to be used for adults, children, and infants dying within the first 28 days of life.</p>
        <!--<div class="govuk-inset-text">This service is available in Wales as a <a href="?bilingual=true&lang=cy">bilingual service in Welsh and English</a>.</div>-->

        <p class="govuk-body">An MCCD is required to register all non-coronial deaths in England and Wales.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">This digital MCCD replaces the paper MCCD. It does not replace your current methods of communication or processes between the medical examiner office and attending practitioner. For example, when discussing a cause of death or an amendment to the MCCD you must continue to contact your colleagues by email or telephone.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who can complete an MCCD</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">An MCCD can be completed by a doctor who attended the deceased person at any time.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If an attending practitioner cannot be found and the senior coroner decides not to investigate the death, they will refer the case to a medical examiner to certify the death. The medical examiner MCCD will only be used in exceptional circumstances.</p>

                An MCCD is not required in the case of a stillbirth
            </strong>
        </div>

        <p class="govuk-body">Registration of stillbirths is a separate process from death certification. Refer to the guidance for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/register-stillbirth" class="govuk-link" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">registering a stillbirth</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who can use this digital MCCD</h2>

            <li>accept or reject an MCCD</li>

            <li>download a completed MCCD to send to the local register office</li>

        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-top-4">The local register office will use the completed MCCD to register the death of a deceased person. The family of a deceased person will not view the MCCD.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-6 govuk-!-margin-bottom-3">Before you start</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">You'll need a secure method of logging in such as your smartcard as supplied by the NHS Care Identity Service.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-6 govuk-!-margin-bottom-3">Before you create or review an MCCD</h2>
