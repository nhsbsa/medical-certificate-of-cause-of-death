        [JIRA - MCCDB-793]
        We will be hosting the service ourselves during Private Beta, meaning
        our Index page has now been merged with the GOV.UK Start page, serving
        two purposes: to educate users about the service AND about the product.

            <p class="govuk-body">If no doctor who cared for the patient can be found, the death must be referred to the coroner to investigate and certify the cause. If the senior coroner decides not to investigate the death, the senior coroner will refer the case to a medical examiner to certify the death by completing an MCCD. The medical examiner MCCD will only be used in exceptional circumstances.</p>
